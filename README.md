# App-For-Friends
A practice C# and WinForms app for my D&D group

## Installation

Run setup.exe in the publish folder.

## System Requirements

This program can only run on Windows. It also requires access to .NET framework, which should already be included on a Windows machine.

## Usage

Running the program will display a single window titled “An App for D&D Friends.” This window has 3 tabs:
- Roll Dice: The default tab when the program opens. This page allows the user to roll multiple dice and see their totals.
- Character Idea Generator: This tab has a single button which will display a randomized D&D race and class.
- Mystery Message: This tab displays a randomized mystery message that only truly magical people will understand.
